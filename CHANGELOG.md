# Changelog

ARENA-py notable changes. Started 2021-19-2.

## [0.1.12] - 2021-19-2
### Added
- Support for user callbacks (`user_join_callback`, `user_left_callback`).
- Use these callbacks to handle when a user joins and leaves, respectively
- `scene.users` will give now you a dictionary of users, mapping object_ids to `Camera` objects.
- Add Changelog.md to keep track of changes.

### Changed
- `Arena` class renamed to `Scene`, but using `Arena` is still allowed. Updated examples to reflect this.
- Tiny bug fix with `update_objects`.
